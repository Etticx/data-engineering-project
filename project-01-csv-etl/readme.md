# Project 1: Sales Data ETL Pipeline
Overview
A simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes sales data from CSV files, cleans and transforms it, then outputs the results in multiple formats.
What I Learned

Reading CSV files with pandas
Data cleaning techniques (removing duplicates, handling missing values)
Data transformation (type conversion, calculated fields)
Data filtering and validation
Writing data to different formats (CSV, JSON)
Basic error handling in Python
